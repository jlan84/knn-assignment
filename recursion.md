# Recursion

Recursion is one of the most important concepts in computer science, yet often a very misunderstood one by even the most competent of engineers.

## ALWAYS remember... TRUST THE RECUSION!

All we need are:

1. A base case(s)
2. Recursive step

For recursion we need both a base case and a recursive step.  The recursive step ensures that we progress.  The base case ensures that our recursion eventually exits.  Also we usually want to pass some data/information around, we do this with function returns. 

## The Quick start to Recursion

1. Pretend you are at the solution
	* This can be a node you are searching for
	* The end of a recursive data structure (i.e. leaves)
	* etc.
2. How do you know you found the solution (what's your base case)
3. Now that you have you answer, how do you get this answer back to the top
4. Since you have solved the problem, assuming you are at the solution... 
5. How do you get to the solution
	* Easier to think one step at a time
	* How do I go one step further
	* If you know how to get from one step to the next, and know when to stop...
6. $$$
